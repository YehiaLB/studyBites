## Front-end Script
studyBites is a Coursera-like website, made for CMPS 278 capstone project. <br>
It has two types of users, regular ones and admins. But more on that later, in the back-end part. <br>
Now, I'm going to showcase our work in the front-end. <br>
Moving from our roadmap, I started by sketching a skeleton for the main pages using photoshop, and how I imagine them to eventually look like. <br>
I then used Twitter's bootstrap to ensure a responsive design (breadcrumbs and burger buttons) <br>
We think our website is accessible, since we included proper alt tags, used color with care and only used tables for data, never for layout. <br> We also made space for video subtitles.
Also, we made use of our daily scrum meetings (in the form of calls) to catch up on each other's progress, while regularly pushing updates to our git repository.

## Back-end Script
In the Back-end part of the project, we used php alongside an SQL database in order to facilitate user login registration, <br>
storing courses and managing them, as well as other features such as user support and assessment managment. <br>
We use php sessions in order to keep the user logged in and we used inline variables added to the URL in order to get certain data
such as which course is being viewed etc... <br>
Ajax was heavily used in order to display items such as courses and user information. <br>
We planned on having an admin access page which we were unfortunatley unable to compelete on time, <br>
which included data tables that used AJAX and Jquery in order to display the tables coming from the database and to give admin provielages to add/delete/and edit courses and users. <br>
The demo shows sample text and videos just to showcase the front end and back end, everythign showcased is dynamic and is based on the data stored on the database. <br>
For the future we would have liked to add features such as reviewing courses, course rating, course filtering, global forums, and a more indepth course page. <br>
Overall we believe the foundation to create a Coursera-like website is there, with the simple need to alter the database.
